    <h2>About Rosebud Kitten Rescue</h2>
   <p>Hi, I’m Amanda — founder of Rosebud Kitten Rescue.</p>

  <p>
    My journey with kittens began when we lived in Irving, TX. A mother cat abandoned her two-week-old kittens near our home, and we simply couldn’t let them starve. My mom and I quickly gathered supplies and began bottle-feeding them. That was my first experience caring for kittens, and it sparked a lifelong calling.
  </p>

  <p>
    After we moved to Red Oak, TX, we noticed that people were dropping off unwanted cats in our neighborhood. As a lifelong cat lover, I couldn’t turn a blind eye. I begged my mom to help feed them, and soon we had a colony of nearly 40 cats. Over time, I gained hands-on experience with kittens — from bottle-feeding to helping moms deliver litters safely.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the most impactful moments came with a cat named Toodles, who had epilepsy. I assisted her through a complicated birth, cutting umbilical cords and breaking water sacs, all while receiving guidance from a vet over the phone. Afterward, I raised the kittens by hand when it became clear it wasn’t safe for her to care for them.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through the years, I’ve helped cats recover from abscesses, infections, and even major injuries — like those caused by car engines. Each challenge taught me more, thanks to the advice and support of local veterinarians. After moving away from home, I continued to help stray and feral cats and fostered for a kitten rescue, where I learned even more — including administering fluids, caring for neonates, and treating common issues like ringworm.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now, with Rosebud Kitten Rescue, I’ve taken everything I’ve learned and created a safe, loving place for kittens and mama cats in need. My mission is to rescue, heal, and find forever homes for as many cats as possible — and to spread kindness along the way.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Thank you for being a part of our journey. 💛🐾</strong></p>
